A special is converted to a special character

A special is a single opeing curly brace {, followed by a tilde ~, follwed by any of the characters in a reference, followed by a single closing curly brace }. Dust supports five “specials”:

<!-- {~s} becomes a single space
{~n} becomes a new line
{~r} becomes a carriage return
{~lb} becomes a left curly brace {
{~rb} becomes a right curly brace } -->
